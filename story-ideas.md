# The World

## Premise

The Earth is dying. A corruption is spreading and will soon engulf all the world, to the end of humanity.

You are a member of one of the last efforts of a dying civilization: A mission to send out 40 Arks into The Deep, in search of new habitable worlds. Each ark is crewed by a single cosmonaut. Each ark holds within it our Tribe's heritage, and supplies to start new somewhere far away.

### The Void

The Void is the emptiness of space between. It is a sort of living emptiness, sometimes a nothing, sometimes a wind, sometimes an all-encompassing ooze. Those with the gift of travel will drift, float, meander their way through The Void. Sometimes if you know where to look or are lucky you can find them.

### The Deep

The Deep is everything in the uncharted places outside of our world. It is mostly Void. In between the vast expanses, though, there are pockets of existence. There is no telling what you will find out there. In some places, reality does not appear to have the same rules. Many have never returned, and the few who have often tell conflicting stories.

## Strange beasts

Strange beasts are known to wander the Deep, though they are rare. You must be careful. Some are more harmless than others.

## Husk rapture

After wandering the Columns of Fire and Dark far within The Deep, a character can become overwhelmed by the vastness, the emptiness, the unforgiving harshness of the infinite. They become a husk. They drift on the winds of the void, never resting, never sleeping. The void has claimed them. Most are never seen again, but occasionally one wanders out back to the Real.

## Treasure sickness

After spending time directly exposed to the void, characters can develop a condition known as Treasure Sickness. The emptiness of the void is hungry, and penetrates the soul. If you are too exposed, it will create a void within you. For many, this void is filled with treasure, hence the name. Your inner void is infinite and insatiable, just like the void from whence it came. As soon as you have filled it and felt relief, the relief is gone and you must seek more.
