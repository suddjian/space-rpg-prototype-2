# The World

## Premise

The Earth is dying. A corruption is spreading and will soon engulf all the world, to the end of humanity.

You are a member of one of the last efforts of a dying civilization: A mission to send out 40 Arks into The Deep, in search of new habitable worlds. Each ark is crewed by a single cosmonaut. Each ark holds within it its Tribe's heritage, and supplies to start new somewhere far away.

### The Void

The Void is the emptiness of space between. It is a sort of living emptiness, sometimes a nothing, sometimes a wind, sometimes an all-encompassing ooze.

Navigating the void is nearly impossible to the uninitiated. The strange currents have a way of delivering you to their own ends, and will throw you onto a strange shore without a second thought if you are not careful.

Those with the gift of travel will drift, float, meander their way through The Void. Sometimes if you know where to look or are lucky you can find them.

### Reaching The Void

To reach The Void, you must take a sturdy, sure ship out to the farthest reaches of the sea. You will reach the farthest isles your kin have ever known. They are barren of life, but for mossy rocks and empty shells.

You sail on. First you will meet the great storms, whose waves would crumple lesser ships. But if you and your ship are built strong, you will come through the storms and the waves, into a clear night. It is always night.

You sail on. The water becomes still. It becomes so still that the stars are reflected perfectly on the surface. It becomes so still that your ship's wake diminishes, until it no longer seems to have a wake. You outrun the moon, which sets behind the horizon. There are only stars above, and only their mirror images below.

You sail on. You begin to see stars that you do not know. You find stars below that do not mirror those above. You can no longer make out any horizon, or even the sea you are sailing upon. The world is all inky black, but for the stars. The smell of the salt air lingers before fading into a musky dankness.

Now you are surrounded by the nothing, and the terrible Void Stars, the Deceivers, which see many a brave traveler to their end.

### The Deep

The Deep is everything in the uncharted places outside of our world. It is mostly Void. In between the vast expanses, though, there are pockets of existence, which are mostly barren and unlit by any sun. There is no telling what you will find out there. In some places, reality does not appear to have the same rules. Many have never returned, and the few who have often tell conflicting stories.

## Strange beasts

Strange beasts are known to wander the Deep, though they are rare. You must be careful. Some are more harmless than others.

## Husk rapture

After wandering the Columns of Fire and Dark far within The Deep, a character can become overwhelmed by the vastness, the emptiness, the unforgiving harshness of the infinite. They become a husk. They drift on the winds of the void, never resting, never sleeping. The void has claimed them. Most are never seen again, but occasionally one wanders out back to the Real.

## Treasure sickness

After spending time directly exposed to the void, characters can develop a condition known as Treasure Sickness. The emptiness of the void is hungry, and penetrates the soul. If you are too exposed, it will create a void within you. Your inner void is infinite and insatiable, just like the void from which it came. As soon as you have filled it and felt relief, the relief is gone and you must seek more.

Many of the first to venture into The Deep were seekers of treasure. So when they developed the sickness, their inner void demanded treasure, and the sickness was so named. But the inner void is not the same for everyone, and these days, many who go out do so for their own reasons.
