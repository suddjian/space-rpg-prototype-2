## Premise

The Earth is dying. A corruption is spreading and will soon engulf all the world, to the end of humanity.

You are a member of one of the last efforts of the dying: A mission to send out 40 Arks into The Deep, in search of new habitable worlds. Each ark is crewed by a single cosmonaut. Each ark holds within it the heritage of one of the Tribes of Earth, and supplies to start new somewhere far away.
